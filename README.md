ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Salma, a 23-year-old Junior Data Scientist currently completing an apprenticeship at **EDF Renouvelables**, where I contribute to impactful data science initiatives within the energy sector. I'm also pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in **Traitement dâ€™Information et Data Science en Entreprise (TIDE)** at **Paris 1 PanthÃ©on-Sorbonne University**.

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m passionate about building data-driven solutions that are transparent, ethical, and grounded in real-world needs. I believe in the importance of model explainability, data quality, and long-term scalability â€” not just code that works, but code that makes sense.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m actively seeking a **full-time Data Scientist role starting December 2025**, ideally within a team that values responsibility, innovation, and impact. Iâ€™m always excited to learn, share, and solve meaningful problems through data.
