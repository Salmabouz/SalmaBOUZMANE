Hello! I'm Salma, a 23-year-old Junior Data Scientist currently completing an apprenticeship at **EDF Renouvelables**, where I contribute to impactful data science initiatives within the energy sector. I'm also pursuing a Master’s degree in **Traitement d’Information et Data Science en Entreprise (TIDE)** at **Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University**.

I’m passionate about building data-driven solutions that are transparent, ethical, and grounded in real-world needs. I believe in the importance of model explainability, data quality, and long-term scalability — not just code that works, but code that makes sense.

I’m actively seeking a **full-time Data Scientist role starting December 2025**, ideally within a team that values responsibility, innovation, and impact. I’m always excited to learn, share, and solve meaningful problems through data.
